# Topic 2: SPA vs MPA

# MPA (Multi Page Application)

- A website where every page is a new page from the server
- Examples:
- Traditional websites
- Old government portals
- Old PHP / JSP websites

# SPA (Single Page Application)

- A website where only one page loads, and content changes without reloading
- Examples:
- Gmail
- Facebook
- Instagram
- WhatsApp Web
  React creates SPA

# Why do we need this?

# Problem with MPA

- In MPA:
- Page reloads again and again
- Slow user experience
- Data reloads every time
  Analogy (very important):

# Why SPA is better
- In SPA:
- Page loads once
- Only content changes
- Much faster
- Smooth experience
