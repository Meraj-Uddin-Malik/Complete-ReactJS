# PHASE 1 — FUNDAMENTALS

# Topic 1: What is React JS?
- React JS is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces (UI).
- Developed by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook
- React helps us create web pages that update fast and feel smooth.

# Why do we need this?
- Before React, websites were:
- Slow to Update
- Hard to Manage
- Full page reload happens again and again

# Problem without React (real-life analogy)
Imagine a notebook 📓
Every time you want to change one line, you must rewrite the whole page.
That’s how old websites worked.

# React Solution
- React updates only the part that changes, not the whole page.
- Faster
- Claen Code
- Better user experience
