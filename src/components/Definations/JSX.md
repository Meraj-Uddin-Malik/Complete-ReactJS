## JSX Definition and Its Purpose

**JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a syntax extension for JavaScript commonly used with React. It allows you to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript files. JSX makes it easier to create and visualize the structure of user interfaces by combining markup and logic in a single place.

### Why Use JSX?

- **Readability:** JSX looks similar to HTML, making UI code more readable and easier to understand.
- **Component Structure:** It helps define the structure of React components in a clear and concise way.
- **Integration with JavaScript:** You can embed JavaScript expressions inside JSX using curly braces `{}`, allowing dynamic content and logic within your UI.
- **Tooling Support:** JSX enables better error messages and editor support, improving the developer experience.

> JSX is not required to use React, but it is widely adopted because it simplifies UI development.
